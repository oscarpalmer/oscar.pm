# Hello, friend

My name is Oscar, and this is my comfy little place on the Internet.

## Oscar, who?

Oscar Palm&eacute;r; yes, I've got an acute accent, and a cute accent. I'm a 90's kid from Sweden with an interest in all things nerdy.

## What I do

Study? I guess so. I'm a systems science student at ["Högskolan i Borås"](//hb.se).

And on the side, I would consider myself a self-taught developer with an interest in web and game development, though school is taking up most of my precious time these days.

## Elsewhere

I [tweet](//twitter.com/ohpalmer) -- though I prefer to read tweets -- make [somewhat useful things](//github.com/oscarpalmer), and [play games](//psnprofiles.com/queo) when I can.

## Goodbye?

Well, that's up to you. You're welcome to [say hi](//twitter.com/ohpalmer) or help me [explore space](//psnprofiles.com/queo) in Destiny.
