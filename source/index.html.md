# Hello, friend

My name is Oscar, and this is my comfy little place on the Internet.

# Oscar, who?

Oscar Palm&eacute;r; yes, I've got an acute accent, and a cute accent.

I'm a 90's kid from Sweden with an interest in all things nerdy, with the exception of chess. No, you know what, chess is kinda cool, too.

# What I do

Study? I guess so. I'm a systems science ‚Äì "systemvetenskap" in Swedish ‚Äì student at ["H&ouml;gskolan i Bor&aring;s"](//hb.se).

And on the side, I would consider myself a self-taught developer with an interest in web and game development, and I'm currently working on a little game, though school is taking up more of my precious time these days.
