### Oscar, who?

Oscar Palm&eacute;r! Yes, I've got an acute accent, and a cute accent. I'm a 90's kid from Sweden with an interest in most things nerdy.

### What do I do?

Study? I guess so. I'm a systems science student at _[Högskolan&nbsp;i&nbsp;Borås](//hb.se)_.

Outside of school, I would consider myself a <i>(self-taught)</i> developer with an interest in web and game development, though my studies are taking up most of my precious time these days.

I also [tweet](//twitter.com/ohpalmer) &ndash; though I prefer to read everyone else's &ndash; make [somewhat&nbsp;useful&nbsp;things](//github.com/oscarpalmer), and [play&nbsp;games](//psnprofiles.com/queo) when I can.

### Is this goodbye?

Well, that's up to you. You're welcome to [say&nbsp;hi](//twitter.com/ohpalmer) or help me [defeat&nbsp;digital&nbsp;baddies](//psnprofiles.com/queo).

![Live long and prosper!](//d2pqc14cgnihq.cloudfront.net/emoji/llap.png)
