Hello. I'm Oscar.

I make computers do [cool stuff](//github.com/oscarpalmer). Mostly stuff for web-related thingamajigs, but also "secret" things.

Oh, okay, fine&hellip; yes, I am working on a game. It'll be tiny, ugly, and filled with lots of words, and it's super cool. Well, it isn't right now, but it will be! <i>Some day, at least.</i>

[Say hi](//twitter.com/ohpalmer), or listen to [what I enjoy](//last.fm/user/denkyuu). If you want to [play games](//psnprofiles.com/queo) with me, then that's cool, too.

See you later, friend,  
XOXO
