  <p>The current iteration of this website was built and uploaded on the <time datetime="<%= today %>"><%= today_in_words %></time>.</p>
  <p>It was built in <a href="//atom.io">Atom</a> on an old MacBook Air, with <a href="//middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> and my template, <a href="//github.com/oscarpalmer/anu">Anu</a>, together with <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/trunk/ERB.html">ERB</a>, <a href="//sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, and <a href="//gulpjs.com">Gulp</a>.</p>
  <p>Some default styling is handled by <a href="//tachyons.io">Tachyons</a>, together with my custom code; if all is well, you should also be seeing the typeface <i>Source Sans Pro</i>, which is provided by <a href="//fonts.adobe.com">Adobe Fonts</a>.</p>
  <p>All source code is hosted on <a href="//github.com/oscarpalmer/oscar.pm">GitHub</a> and hosted on <a href="//netlify.com">Netlify</a>; with every push to <i>GitHub</i>, the data is also sent to <i>Netlify</i>, where it will then build <i>(and publish)</i> the site across its network.</p>
  <p>This domain is provided by <a href="//iwantmyname.com">iwantmyname</a>, but all <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> stuff is currently handled by <a href="//www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>.</p>
  <p>A complete run-down of all related information is available in the <a href="humans.txt">humans.txt file</a>.</p>
