    title: Quest
    description: 'A <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> router; similar to <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, but smaller and less competent. Useful for making defining verb-specific routes and actions for them, e.g. displaying a welcoming message on a start page.'
  -
    title: Shelf
    description: An <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>-abstraction for working with requests and responses in PHP; it's definitely inspired by <a href="https://rack.github.io">Rack</a>, which powers a lot of my Ruby-projects.

  -
    title: Skrolla
